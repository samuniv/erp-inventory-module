		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Scaffolding & Docker Environment Setup",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Project Scaffolding & Docker Environment Setup' task into subtasks for: 1. Initializing the Git repository and creating the .NET solution structure. 2. Adding and configuring the PostgreSQL service in Docker Compose. 3. Adding and configuring the Oracle XE service in Docker Compose. 4. Adding and configuring the Apache Kafka and Zookeeper services in Docker Compose.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves multiple distinct infrastructure components (Postgres, Oracle, Kafka) and project setup (Git, .NET solution). Each component requires specific configuration and verification, making it ideal for decomposition."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "API Gateway (YARP) Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'API Gateway (YARP) Implementation' task into subtasks for: 1. Creating the `Gateway.API` .NET project and installing the YARP package. 2. Configuring initial routes and clusters in `appsettings.json` for all backend services. 3. Implementing and configuring the CORS policy to allow requests from the frontend.",
			"reasoning": "While not overly complex, the task has distinct steps: creating the API project, configuring YARP routes/clusters, and setting up the CORS policy. These can be tracked separately."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Auth.Service Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Auth.Service Implementation' task into subtasks covering project setup, database integration with Identity, endpoint implementation for registration and login, JWT generation logic, and setting up integration tests with Testcontainers.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves multiple distinct components: API setup, Identity configuration, database migration, JWT logic, and endpoint implementation. The complexity is high due to the security-critical nature and the integration of .NET Identity, which has a steep learning curve."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate JWT Authentication into API Gateway",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Integrate JWT Authentication into API Gateway' task into subtasks for adding JWT Bearer services, configuring the authentication handler to validate tokens from Auth.Service, and applying a global authorization policy to YARP routes.",
			"reasoning": "This is a focused configuration task. The complexity is moderate because it requires precise coordination with the Auth.Service, but the code changes are minimal. It can be broken into configuring the service, applying the policy, and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Supplier.Service CRUD API Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Supplier.Service CRUD API' task into subtasks for project setup with Oracle EF Core, implementing CQRS queries (GetAll, GetById), implementing CQRS commands (Create, Update, Delete), creating the API endpoints to handle these requests, and writing integration tests with Testcontainers for Oracle.",
			"reasoning": "The task combines standard API development with the CQRS pattern (MediatR) and a less common database (Oracle). This adds a layer of abstraction and setup complexity compared to a basic CRUD service, justifying a moderate score."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Inventory.Service API & Kafka Alert Publisher",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Inventory.Service API & Kafka Alert Publisher' task into subtasks for implementing the core CRUD API with Oracle, integrating the Kafka client and configuring the producer, adding the business logic to check stock levels and trigger publishing, creating the Kafka message contract, and setting up multi-container integration tests for Oracle and Kafka.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to combining a standard CRUD API with event-driven architecture (Kafka producer). The testing strategy is also complex, requiring two separate Testcontainers (Oracle and Kafka) to run concurrently."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Order.Service API & Kafka Event Handling",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Order.Service API & Kafka Event Handling' task into subtasks for: 1. API and DB setup. 2. Implementing the order creation endpoint with Kafka publishing. 3. Creating the `IHostedService` for the Kafka consumer. 4. Implementing the consumer logic to process inventory alerts. 5. Defining event contracts for both produced and consumed messages. 6. Writing integration tests for both the API/producer and the consumer logic.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex as it involves three major responsibilities: a web API, a Kafka producer, and a Kafka consumer running as a background service. Each of these is a substantial piece of work with its own testing requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Angular SPA Foundation: Shell, Routing, & Auth",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Angular SPA Foundation' task into subtasks for project and Material setup, creating the main app shell and layout, implementing the routing module with public and protected routes, building the login component and authentication service, and implementing the AuthGuard and HTTP Interceptor.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational frontend task. The complexity comes from integrating several core Angular features (Services, Routing, Guards, Interceptors) to create a robust authentication flow, which is critical for the entire application."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Angular Inventory Module: List, Detail, & Forms",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Angular Inventory Module' task into subtasks for creating the data service to fetch inventory data, building the list component with a filterable MatTable, creating the reactive form for creating/editing items within a MatDialog, and wiring up the full CRUD functionality.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard feature development task. The complexity lies in integrating multiple components (table, dialog, form) and a service. It's a self-contained unit of work but involves several moving parts within the Angular framework."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Angular Supplier Module: Management via Tables & Dialogs",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Angular Supplier Module' task into subtasks for creating the SupplierService for API communication, building the supplier list component using MatTable with search, creating the supplier reactive form inside a MatDialog, and integrating the create, update, and delete actions.",
			"reasoning": "This task is functionally identical to the Inventory module (Task 9) but for a different domain. The complexity and breakdown are therefore the same: service layer, list view, form/dialog, and action integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Angular Order Module: Multi-Step Creation Wizard",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Angular Order Module' task into subtasks for setting up the MatStepper component, creating a state management service for the order wizard, building each step of the form (customer info, item selection, review), and implementing the final submission logic.",
			"reasoning": "The use of a multi-step wizard with `MatStepper` introduces significant state management complexity that doesn't exist in a simple CRUD form. Managing state across steps is a non-trivial challenge, justifying a high complexity score."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Backend Resilience Patterns (Polly)",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Backend Resilience Patterns' task into subtasks for configuring Polly retry/circuit-breaker policies for HTTP clients in all services, wrapping database and Kafka calls with explicit Polly policies, adding logging to policies for visibility, and creating integration tests to simulate failures and verify policy execution.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity arises from this being a cross-cutting concern affecting all services and different types of I/O (HTTP, DB, Kafka). Testing resilience policies correctly by simulating failures is also a significant and difficult part of the task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Backend Integration Testing with Testcontainers",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Backend Integration Testing' task into subtasks for creating reusable xUnit fixtures or base classes for each container type (PostgreSQL, Oracle, Kafka), refactoring existing tests to use these fixtures, writing new end-to-end tests that validate cross-service interactions, and integrating the full test suite into the CI pipeline.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is not in writing a single test, but in building a robust, reusable, and reliable integration testing framework for all services. This involves creating abstractions (fixtures/base classes) and writing more complex multi-container tests."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Observability & Health Checks Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Observability & Health Checks' task into subtasks for: 1. Integrating Serilog for structured logging in all services. 2. Configuring OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and metrics export. 3. Implementing health checks for each service and its dependencies (DB, Kafka). 4. Verifying the setup by scraping metrics and checking health endpoints.",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex cross-cutting concern involving the integration of multiple distinct technologies (Serilog, OpenTelemetry, HealthChecks) across all microservices. Each technology requires its own setup, configuration, and verification."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "CI/CD Pipeline Setup with GitHub Actions",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'CI/CD Pipeline Setup' task into subtasks for creating the frontend Angular workflow (install, lint, test, build), creating the backend .NET workflow (build, unit test), configuring the backend workflow to support Docker for running Testcontainers integration tests, and setting up triggers and branch protection rules.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is high due to the requirement of running Testcontainers-based integration tests within a CI environment, which can be difficult to configure correctly on CI runners. This requires significant DevOps expertise beyond typical application code."
